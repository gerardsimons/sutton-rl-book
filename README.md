# Sutton & Bart - Deep Reinforcement Learning Book

This repository is aimed at providing exercise answers, summaries and other experiments to accompany the amazing RL book of Richard Sutton and Andrew G. Barto, which you can find for free online, [here]().

I am sure there are other similar repo's or websites floating about, but I just wanted to create one for myself and other people interested in it. I started out with a few exercises that I made in Ipython notebooks. It would be nice if we could have a separate summaries section and possible extended experiments that people have done that were inspired by this book.

I cannot stress enough that the answers written down here are by no means the definitive answers. They are just my answers (and hopefully those of other )

## Contributing

I hope other will want to share their answers and other contributions. I foresee it as anyone being able to create a branch and supplying any alternative exercise answers as edits if there was another answer before it. We can then discuss these issues in the "Issues" section.

If anyone has any other ideas about structuring this repo, do suggest, I am open to any ideas.
